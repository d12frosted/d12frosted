- I'm an engineering manager from Chi»ôinƒÉu, Moldova; based in Kyiv, Ukraine. My time is often consumed by work, tinkering with Emacs, delving into the world of wine, and embarking on quests in [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/) (or other video games). 
- I share much of my Emacs journey on GitHub, alongside musings on my [technical blog](https://d12frosted.io). 
- I also detail my experiences with wine and the various tasting events I partake in or organise on [üçá Barberry Garden ü¶Ñ](https://barberry.io).
