[![Stand With Ukraine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/main/badges/StandWithUkraine.svg)](https://stand-with-ukraine.pp.ua)

I'm an engineering manager from Chișinău, Moldova, currently based in Kyiv, Ukraine.

I spend most of my free time tinkering with Emacs. My [technical blog](https://d12frosted.io) is where I write about that journey — the tools I build, the problems I solve, and the occasional opinion I can't keep to myself. Most of my work ends up as open source here on GitHub.

When I'm not in Emacs, I'm either exploring wine (documented on [Barberry Garden](https://barberry.io) — a personal wine database built with Emacs and org-mode, because of course it is), embarking on quests in [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/), or writing about games, books, anime and movies on [Tasogare](https://tasogare.ink).
